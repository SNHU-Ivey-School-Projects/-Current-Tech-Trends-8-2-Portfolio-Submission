# -Current-Tech-Trends-8-2-Portfolio-Submission



Explanation: Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
For this project work I created the neural network model that connected the databases and dat flow for the privacy of authenticated encrypted software. In addition I created the code for the Q-Training Algorithm that helped the intelligent agent to achieve its goal.


Question: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Answer: Computer Scientist use data science, robotics machine learning and computer programming methodologies and principle concepts to develop and improve computer systems, embedded software and  enrcrypted and decrypted cipher algorithms.


Question: How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Answer: As a computer scientist it is important to scientifically analyze every component of a system and make sure test are cnsistently happening to ensure code quality. Delivering clean runnable code is important and vital for the approaching complex problems as a computer scientist.

Question: What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Privacy and Zero Tust Security Process Policies are essential for uplholding and complying with industry best coding standards.
